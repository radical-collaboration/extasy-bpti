The aim of the project is to explore the performance of one of the ExTASY tools
– CoCo-MD – for advanced simulation when applied to a biologically-relevant test
case, the protein BPTI. Very long and computationally expensive conventional
simulations have shown how hard it is to properly explore the shape-space of
BPTI – can CoCo-MD do better? Using the ExTASY toolkit, you will run advanced
sampling simulations of BPTI on a range of supercomputer resources. Working with
biomoleciular simulation scientists in the UK, you will analyse the sampling
data produced, and optimise the simulation parameters to identify how best
performance can be achieved.
